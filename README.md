An Attendee account can view the list of alla events and can subsribe/unsuscribe from them directly on the event-list page via the button. He can also view all the events to which he is subscribed 
(and unsuscrbe from them). Finally he can view his account personal informations.

An Organizer account can also manage his events with a new button in the menu. In the managing page he can create new events or delete the ones he has already organized. 
When deleting an event a notification will be shown in the menu of everyone who was subscribed to that event.
